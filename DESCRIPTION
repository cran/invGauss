Description: invGauss fits the (randomized drift) inverse Gaussian distribution to survival data. The model is described in Aalen OO, Borgan O, Gjessing HK. Survival and Event History Analysis. A Process Point of View. Springer, 2008. It is based on describing time to event as the barrier hitting time of a Wiener process, where drift towards the barrier has been randomized with a Gaussian distribution. The model allows covariates to influence starting values of the Wiener process and/or average drift towards a barrier, with a user-defined choice of link functions.
